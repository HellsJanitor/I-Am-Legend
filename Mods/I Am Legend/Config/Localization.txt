tutorialTipQuest01,"Six billion people on Earth when the infection hit. The Krippin Virus had a 90 percent kill rate; that's 5.4 BILLION people, dead. Crashed and bled out. Dead. Less than one-percent immunity. That left 12 million healthy people, like you.\n\nThe other 588 MILLION turned into Dark Seekers, and then they got hungry, and they killed and fed on everybody. EVERYBODY!\n\nEvery single person that you or I has ever known is dead! DEAD!\n\nTHERE IS NO GOD!\n\n[32cd32]ABOUT THE 'I AM LEGEND' MOD.[-]\n\nZombies (Dark Seekers) [cd5c5c]do not[-] spawn in the wild during the day.

IAmLegendTip02,"There are 4 types of Dark Seeker; [cd5c5c]Normal[-] (both male & female), [ed9121]Hunter[-], [ffc40c]Alpha[-] (male & female), and [6a5acd]Spitter[-].\n\n[cd5c5c]Normal[-] Dark Seekers are various humans, infected by KV. They have different characteristics, such as movement speed, movement type, and health, but are effectively the 'grunts' of the Dark Seekers.\n\n[ed9121]Hunters[-] move on all fours, can jump much bigger distances, and can launch a leaping attack on unsuspecting individuals.\n\n[ffc40c]Alphas[-] are bigger, tougher, and look more skeletal, but can be just as fast.\n\n[6a5acd]Spitters[-] have evolved to launch acidic projectiles at whatever they're hunting, and when damaged, have a tendency to explode, damaging anything around them. They are more skeletal than 'normals', but they look more animalistic, with mandibles instead of a mouth.\n\nThere are also 2 sub-variants of these creatures. [ffc40c]Feral[-], characterized by glowing yellow eyes, and MUCH tougher than non-ferals; and [008000]Radiated[-], characterized by their glowing green skin. As tough as feral variants, Radiated Dark Seekers can regenerate health at an alarming rate."
